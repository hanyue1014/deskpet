## My attempt of making a desktop pet using go (desktop pet were always smtg I wanted)
Not sure how far I will go with my skills

Basic functionalities that I want:
- Basic interactions (able to click on it and it will react)
- ...
- that's all for now, will add more when the previous functionality is achieved

I wanna be more preservative in terms of functionalities as this project also intents to let me gain knowledge
